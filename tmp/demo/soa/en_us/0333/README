                                  README
                                    FOR
                       IBM INFORMIX 4GL 7.50.xC3 RELEASE
                       i4glsoademo Demonstration Program   
                                  May 2009
                      =================================

The i4glsoademo demonstration program covers how to:

* publish an I4GL Web Service
* subscribe to an I4GL Web Service

I. Prerequisites:
=================
A. The following environment variables must be set:

   AXIS2C_HOME
   CLASS_PATH
   INFORMIXDIR
   INFORMIXSERVER
   INFORMIXSQLHOSTS
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   PATH

B. A new directory for the demonstration files must be created:   

   1. To create a new directory:

      mkdir /work/zipcodedemo

   2. To access the new directory:

      cd /work/zipcodedemo


II. Running the demonstration program:
======================================

A. Locate and run the demonstration executable:

   $INFORMIXDIR/bin/i4glsoademo

B. The following files are copied into the /work/zipcodedemo directory:

   mki4glsoa.4gl     - Creates the database and table for the demo
   soa_load.4gl      - Loads the data into the table
   statedetails.unl  - Data file used by soa_load.4gl
   soademo.4cf       - Configuration file used to deploy the 4GL function
                       as a Web service.
   soademo.4gl       - 4GL function deployed as an I4GL Web Service
   clientsoademo.4cf - Configuration file used to consume the 4GL function
                       as a Web service
   clsoademo.4gl     - 4GL function consuming an I4GL Web Service

C. The following executables are created:

   soa_load          - To load the table
   zipcode_client    - client executable


D. The following flowchart shows how the client invokes the 4GL function through  Apache 
AXIS2/C (AXIS2/C):

   +-----[ 1 ]------+       +-----[ 2 ]----+
   |                |       |  Apache's    |
   |                |       |  AXIS2C App  |
   |./zipcode_client|<----->|  Server      |
   |                |       |              |
   |                |       |  Port: 9876  |
   +----------------+       +--------------+
                                ^
                                |
                                |
                                |
                                V
                          +----[ 3 ]------+        +-----[ 4 ]-----+
                          |   Invokes     |        |  IDS Server   |
                          | 4GL Function  |        |               |
                          |               |        |  Access table |
                          |zipcode_details||<----->|  statedetails |
                          |               |        |               |
                          |               |        | Return record |
                          +---------------+        +---------------+

  1. The "ws_zipcode" Web Service is deployed.

  2. The client executable makes the call to invoke the Web Service.

  3. The AXIS2/C server listening at port number 9876 (for example) receives the requests. 
  4. The AXIS2/C server invokes the Web Service "ws_zipcode", which then  invokes the 4GL function "zipcode_details" and contacts the IDS server to get the corresponding CITY name and STATE name for the zip code.

  5. The return values are communicated back to the client executable.

 E. Alternatively, the process can be run manually with the following steps:  

    1. cd $INFORMIXDIR/AXIS2C/bin

    2. ./axis2_http_server -p 9876 &

    3. cd /work/zipcodedemo  //From which i4glsoademo was run

    4. ./zip_codeclient  //Displays the output
