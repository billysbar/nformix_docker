############################################################################## 
# This script prepares the parts of the 4gl "blob demo" program
# for use.  It copies the following files to the current directory
# if they do not already exist there:
#
#	blobdemo.4gl		-- program source
#	blobshow.sh		-- script that calls xwud for blobdemo.4gl
#	main_bd.per		-- main window form
#	pict_bd.per		-- picture (cat_picture) form
#	text_bd.per		-- text (cat_descr) form
#	varc_bd.per		-- varchar (cat_advert) form
#
# The program compiles the forms if they have not already been compiled.
#
# It determines which 4gl compiler (c4gl or fglpc) to use, and
# compiles the source program if it has not already been compiled.
