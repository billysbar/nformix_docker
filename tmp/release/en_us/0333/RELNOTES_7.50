III.  New features in 7.50.xC3
_________________________________________
With IBM Informix 4GL 7.50.xC3, I4GL programs can subscribe to Web
services written in I4GL or any modern programming language. The product
contains sample demonstrations on how to publish an I4GL Web service and 
how to subscribe to an I4GL Web service using an I4GL subscriber. 

IV.   New features in 7.50.xC2
_________________________________________

With IBM Informix 4GL 7.50.xC2, you can deploy your 4GL functions on 
the Web without rewriting any source code. The w4gl utility uses your 
existing 4GL code to create Web services. These Web services can be 
used by, for example, Java and .Net applications on the Web without 
you doing any Java or .NET programming.  Your business logic is 
maintained in 4GL, and made available to a variety of Web clients by 
the Web services.        

V.    New features in 7.50.xC1
_________________________________________

Informix 4GL 7.50.xC1 supports UTF-8 character encoding. To convert your 
existing databases to UTF-8, use a standard converter or enter the 
non-English characters manually. English language users can unload data 
from the existing en_us database and reload it into the new utf8 database.

                      directory error'.

        IC57901B       ISQL FORM display has different behavior on 7.50. On ISQL 
                      7.50.FC1, every time when input characters into the query 
                      field, the form refreshes. Problem does not happened on 7.32.

VIII. Customer-reported Defects fixed in 7.50.xC1
        _______________________________________________

        Defect #      Description
        ________      ___________      


        IC51780       i4gldemo does not print correct value in money 
                      field on invoice sheet when we set Japanese locale 

        IC52360       When we update one of column on isql form, the

        IC52435       Program crashes with error 1150 : Window is too 
                      small to display this

                      cursor before table create, and call function to 
                      loop through cursor

        IC55543       SDKs newer than 3.00.xC3 may not be compatible with 
                      current 4GL on AIX.

                      carriage return of the string from C function

IX.   Known Issues and Workarounds
____________________________________

A. The 4GL version 7.50.xC3 Web services functionality is not compatible 
   with IDS version 7.31.
   

B. In IBM Informix 4GL version 7.50.HC1 and later, the compiler "c4gl" returns 
   the following error when trying to compile any 4GL program:

   /usr/ccs/bin/ld: Can't find library: "cur_colr"

   Workaround:
        
   In HP-UX 11.31, create a symbolic link for libcur_colr.1 under 
   $INFORMIXDIR/lib/esql and $INFORMIXDIR/lib/tools directories 
   which points to /usr/lib/libcurses.sl.

   For example:
    
   ln -s /usr/lib/libcurses.sl $INFORMIXDIR/lib/esql/libcur_colr.1
   ln -s /usr/lib/libcurses.sl $INFORMIXDIR/lib/tools/libcur_colr.1
  
C. When using the Development version of 4GL 7.50.xC2 and later to deploy 
   the 4GL function as a web service, if any of the files or 
   directories in the directory pointed to by the $TMPDIR in the 
   configuration file do not have permissions, the PERL script 
   returns this error: 
      
   This is an issue with the application org.apache.axis2.wsdl.WSDL2C 
   used by this deployment tool.
   
   
   Exception in thread "main" org.apache.axis2.wsdl.codegen.
             CodeGenerationException: java.lang.NullPointerException
           at org.apache.axis2.wsdl.codegen.CodeGenerationEngine.
              generate(CodeGenerationEngine.java:278)
           at org.apache.axis2.wsdl.WSDL2Code.main(WSDL2Code.java:35)
           at org.apache.axis2.wsdl.WSDL2C.main(WSDL2C.java:31)
   Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
           at org.apache.axis2.wsdl.codegen.extension.JavaPrettyPrinter
              Extension.prettify(JavaPrettyPrinterExtension.java:49)
           at org.apache.axis2.wsdl.codegen.extension.JavaPrettyPrinter
              Extension.prettify(JavaPrettyPrinterExtension.java:50)

           at org.apache.axis2.wsdl.codegen.CodeGenerationEngine.
              generate(CodeGenerationEngine.java:272)
           ... 2 more
   
   
       This error occurs frequently when /tmp is the designated $TMPDIR
       because /tmp is shared by all the users and all the processes. 
   
       $TMPDIR should be used by one user only and should not contain any files
       or directories that do not have permissions.  

   
   Workaround:


       Option 1: Create a new directory and designate it as a $TMPDIR. For example,

                    mkdir /tmp/w4gl_<loginid>

                 In the example above, <loginid> is the user's login id into the 
                 operating system.


       Option 2: Remove all the files or directories from $TMPDIR for which the 
                 user does not have privileges.
