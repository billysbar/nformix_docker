<h1 id="i1087880">Overview</h1>
<p>This file lists known errata, and some feature and performance
topics that are not covered in the manuals, or for which the
behavior of 4GL differs from the description in the manuals.
Please examine this file, because it contains vital information
on 4GL application and performance issues.</p>
<p>See also the Release Notes that are provided with 4GL 7.50.</p>

<a name="i1086329"></a>
<h2 id="i1086329">Changes to Product Names</h2>

<p>These manuals may refer to IBM Informix database servers by
names that became obsolete in the third quarter of 1999.
In addition, the names of the products formerly known as
"INFORMIX-4GL C Compiler" and "INFORMIX-4GL Rapid Development
System" (RDS) have been changed to "IBM Informix 4GL C
Compiler" and "IBM Informix 4GL Rapid Development System"
respectively, but the manuals and message files for these
client products generally do not use the new names. The term
"4GL" is used in most contexts by the user manuals (and by
these documentation notes) to abbreviate both of these
client product names. </p>

<p>Products and documentation that include the word "Informix"
are now "IBM Informix." Except for pathnames, configuration
parameters, environment variables, and user "informix," the
word "IBM" should be prefixed to any reference to "Informix"
in any context of the products, documentation, or other
instances of the string "Informix."
 </p>

<a name="ii10878801"></a>
<h2 id="i10878801">4GL Documentation Included with This Release</h2>

<h2 id="i1087880c">Notes on IBM Informix 4GL Concepts and Use</h2>

<p>This manual does not demonstrate features that were added
in Version 7.31 or later, including dynamic arrays, SQL
blocks, dynamic configuration of reports, the CENTURY
attribute for abbreviated years, conditional comments,
new features for screen-array management, and support
for editing multi-byte characters in screen forms.
All of these features, however, are described in the
IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual.</p>

<a name="i1086329a"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329a">Dynamic Arrays</h3>

<p>IBM Informix 4GL 7.32 introduces the use of the dynamic array
structured data type.</p>

<p>The following changes should be made to Chapter 5: </p>

<p>Page 3, Declaration of Variables section,
the sentence that reads "Data can be structured as records or
arrays and can be allocated statically or dynamically." should read
"Data can be structured as records, arrays, or dynamic arrays." </p>

<p>Page 4, first bullet point, the sentence that reads "Every
data type of 4GL except ARRAY, BYTE, TEXT, and RECORD is a simple
data type." should read "Every data type of 4GL except ARRAY,
DYNAMIC ARRAY, BYTE, TEXT, and RECORD is a simple data type." </p>

<p>Page 4, second bullet point, the sentence that reads "Structured
data types (ARRAY and RECORD) can store ordered sets of values."
should read  "Structured data types (ARRAY, DYNAMIC ARRAY, and
RECORD) can store ordered sets of values." </p>

<p>Page 5, Data Structures section, the first two paragraphs should read:
"The structured data types enable you to organize program data
into records, arrays, and dynamic arrays, which are sometimes
called data structures. </p>

<p>The ARRAY, DYNAMIC ARRAYS, and RECORD data types can store
ordered sets of values of other 4GL data types. You can also
declare an ARRAY variable whose elements are RECORD variables,
or a RECORD variable that has ARRAY or RECORD members, but you
cannot declare an ARRAY of ARRAY variables." </p>

<p>For information about the DYNAMIC ARRAY data type, refer to
Chapter 3 of the IBM Informix 4GL Reference Book. </p>

<p>The following changes should be made to Chapter 8: </p>

<p>Page 12, Creating Structured Data Types section, the sentence
that reads "You specify the structure of a variable by stating
that it is an ARRAY or a RECORD in the DEFINE statement." should
read "You specify the structure of a variable by stating
that it is an ARRAY, DYNAMIC ARRAY, or a RECORD in the DEFINE
statement." </p>

<p>For information on declaring a DYNAMIC ARRAY, see the DEFINE
Statement in Chapter 4 of the IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual. </p>

<p>Page 8, bullet point three of the Introduction asserts that
"For any SQL statement that your database server supports,
you can use the SQL ... END SQL delimiters." This is an
exaggeration: the SQL statement must be preparable. Because
an SQL block can include host variables, however, SQL statements
that can appear in SQL blocks are a superset of SQL statements
that can be prepared, because PREPARE cannot include host
variables in its text. </p>

<p>Pages 6-4 and 9-3 say that post-4.10 SQL syntax must be
prepared. Another (and usually more convenient) option is
to put the post-4.10 SQL statement within SQL ... END SQL
delimiters, which the "SQL" section of Chapter 4 describes
in the "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual." </p>

<h3 id="i1086329c">Compiling 4GL to C</h3>

<p>The description on page 4-13 of 3-stage compilation to C
code is simplified and obsolete. See "The Five-Phase I4GL
Compilation Process" in Chapter 1 of the "IBM Informix 4GL
Reference Manual" for a more accurate description. </p>


<a name="i1086329d"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329d">Non-ASCII Characters in 4GL Programs</h3>
<p>The assertion on page 4-6 that 4GL form specifications are
"ASCII files" describes releases earlier than Version 7.2.
The GLS features of 4GL allow forms to include non-ASCII
characters from the code set of the locale. (Besides this
section, the 4GL documentation set often uses the terms
"ASCII file" and "ASCII character" in contexts where in
fact locale-dependent non-ASCII characters are also valid.) </p>

<a name="i1086329e"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329e">Scope of Reference</h3>
<p>The assertion on page 4-10 that global variables must be
declared and imported with the GLOBALS statement refers
only to variables that the 4GL programmer declares.
Built-in global variables (like the SQLCA record, status,
int_flag, and quit_flag) are known to the compiler and
runtime without any action of the 4GL programmer, and the
same is true of the built-in global constants TRUE, FALSE,
and NOTFOUND, as page 5-9 correctly indicates. </p>

<p>Page 8-14 defines a local variable as one that the DEFINE
statement declares within a "function." More generally,
a local variable is one that you declare within a "program
block," which can be a FUNCTION, MAIN, or REPORT statement. </p>


<a name="i1086329f"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329f">Fatal Errors</h3>

<p>Page 5-14 asserts that "fatal" or untrappable errors exist
that WHENEVER cannot trap. Releases of 4GL earlier than
Version 6.0 could produce such errors, but not this release.
Some other books in this documentation set also include
obsolete references to fatal errors. </p>


<a name="i1086329g"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329g">Line Mode and Formatted Mode</h3>

<p>The Chapter 7 discussion of Line mode and Formatted mode
does not mention that OPTIONS, RUN, START REPORT ... TO
PIPE, and REPORT ... OUTPUT TO PIPE can explicitly specify
IN LINE MODE or IN FORM MODE interaction. The "IBM Informix 4GL
Reference Manual" describes these 4GL syntax features. </p>


<a name="i1086329h"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329h">Imprecise Language</h3>

<p>Page 5-3 characterizes 4GL as a "strongly typed" language.
Some would disagree with this assertion, because 4GL does
not require explicit casts for most data-type conversion. </p>

<p>On pages 8-9 and 8-10, the term "blob" refers to TEXT or
BYTE variables or to TEXT or BYTE database columns. "Blob"
was introduced in the Version 4.0 database server and 4GL
releases, but is now obsolete. As the text indicates,
TEXT and BYTE are called "large" data types in current
IBM Informix documentation. (The term "blob" also appears
in Chapter 5 and in the Index.) </p>

<p>On page 8-12, the "dot notation" is less colloquially
referred to as the "membership operator" (for example,
in Chapter 5 of "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual"). </p>

<p>Page 8-25 defines the first index of a substring as "the
position of the first character to extract." This is true
in single-byte locales, but what it really specifies is the
first "byte" to extract. In some East-Asian locales, a
single logical "character" can require more than one byte.
Similarly, the expressions delConfirm[4.4] and delConfirm[4]
are "single-byte values," not "single-space characters,"
and companies[61][1.7] on the same page returns seven bytes,
which are not necessarily "seven letters." (See Chapter 5 of
the "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual" for details of using
the substring operator of 4GL in multibyte locales.) </p>

<p>The term "subroutine" on page 11-17 means "function." </p>


<a name="i1086329i"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329i">Errors of Fact</h3>

<p>On page 8-26, the last sentence of the first paragraph
should say that 4GL substitutes a single blank character
(rather than "blank characters") for a NULL value. </p>

<p>The assertion on page 8-32 that the example includes only
one executable statement is false. Besides the RETURN
statement, the LET statement is also executable. </p>

<p>On page 9-8, the code example ignores the issue of cursor
name mangling. See the description of CURSOR_NAME() in
Chapter 5 of the "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual" for
more information about cursor name mangling. (But if
you are using Dynamic 4GL, this code example is valid.) </p>


<a name="i1086329j"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329j">Reserved Lines</h3>
<p>On page 11-33, the section "Getting the Most on the Screen"
neglects to mention that the OPEN WINDOW statement can hide
the COMMENT line, as Chapter 4 of the "IBM Informix 4GL
Reference Manual" describes. </p>


<a name="i1086329k"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329k">Control Keys as Activation Keys</h3>

<p>Asterisk (*) symbols in the table on pages 11-36 and 11-37
are described as indicating that those control keys cannot
be used in an ON KEY clause. In fact, 4GL does not prevent
you from defining these keys as activation keys, but doing
so prevents the user from using them as editing keys. For
example, "Guide to the IBM Informix 4GL Interactive Debugger"
shows code to redefine the CONTROL-I key on page 2-4. </p>

<p>No other problems are known to exist with this manual. </p>

<a name="i1086329mmm"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329mmm">The fgltypes.h file does not exist</h3>
<p>Appendix C contains multiple references to a non-existent file
named fgltypes.h.</p>

<p>Users should ignore every reference to the non-existent file
named fgltypes.h.</p>


<a name="i1086329m"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329m">Name Conflicts in DEFINE Statements</h3>


<p>Variables that you declare in the DEFINE statement of 4GL must
not have the same identifier as any user type.  For example,
the following statement declares variables called int2,
int4, and myvar: </p>

<pre class="xmp">DEFINE  int2,int4 SMALLINT,  myVar2 INT;</pre>

<p>With the Rapid Development System, this statement produces
valid p-code. If you use c4gl to produce a compiled C
language version, however, the same statement causes a
compilation error, because in the C language, variables
and data types share the same namespace.   For the example
above, the equivalent C code is this: </p>

<pre class="xmp">short int2,int4;
int4 myVar2;</pre>

<p>Most C compilers (such as gcc and the AIX compiler, for
example) issue no warning that you are about to define a
variable with the same name as a user type.  Some earlier
versions of IBM Informix 4GL could compile declarations
of variables with names that match user types, but this version
does not support variables whose names are defined in files
such as ifxtypes.h, or that your C compiler recognizes as
the name of a C type. </p>

<a name="i1086329n"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329n">FGL_SETCURRLINE( ) Function Takes Two Arguments</h3>

<p>In Chapter 4, Built-In Functions and Operators, the description
of FGL_SETCURRLINE( ) omits one of the two arguments to this
function and incorrectly describes some details of its usage: </p>

<p>During the INPUT ARRAY or DISPLAY ARRAY statement, the
FGL_SETCURRLINE( ) function positions the database cursor at a
specified program record of the current program array, and
displays that record (and the screen cursor) on a specified
line of the current screen array. </p>

<p>The FGL_SETCURRLINE( ) function has this calling syntax: </p>

       <pre class-"xmp">FGL_SETCURRLINE (  line_scr , num_record  )</pre>

<p>The Version 7.32 syntax diagram refers to the second argument
as <pre class="xmp"> num </pre> but omits the first argument.) </p>

<p>Here line_scr  is a literal integer, specifying the ordinal
position of a line in the screen array that the current
INPUT ARRAY or DISPLAY ARRAY statement specifies.
(The SCR_LINE( ) function returns this value when the screen
cursor is in the same line of this screen array.) </p>

<p>The num_rec  is a literal integer, specifying the ordinal number
of a record in the program array that  INPUT ARRAY or
DISPLAY ARRAY specifies. (The ARR_CURR( ) function returns this
value when the current line of a screen array displays this
record from the same program array.) </p>

<p>In summary,  FGL_SETCURRLINE( ) requires two ( 2 ) arguments, one
of which references a screen array, and the other a program array: </p>

<p>The first integer argument specifies the line of the current
screen array in which to position the screen cursor and to
display the record in the current program array that the second
argument to this function specifies. </p>

<p>The second integer argument specifies the ordinal position
in the active set of database cursor of a program record that
this function displays in the screen array line that the first
argument to this function specifies. </p>

<a name="i1086329o"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329o">The c4gl Command</h3>

<p>In Chapter 1, the syntax diagram and description of c4gl
does not make clear that if the -c option is used, then
no library options should also be included. </p>

<p>The same diagram also shows that -ansi (if it is included)
must be the first command-line flag.  This is incorrect.
The -phase 12345 flags and several other flags can precede
the -ansi flag.  See the following BNF command-line syntax: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
 c4gl [-Vaeqcz] [-phase 12345] [-ansi] [-anyerr]
      [-globcurs | -localcurs] [-nokeep | -keep]
      [-static | -shared]  [-otherargs]
       source.4gl ... [othersrc.c ...] [otheresql.ec ...]
      [otherobj.o ...] [yourlib.a ...] [-o outfile]

     -V            Display version number of 4gl (and then exit)
     -a            Do array bounds checking
     -e            Preprocess only, no compilation nor linking
     -q            Quiet mode for i4glc1 [phase 1]
     -c            Preprocess & compile only, no linking
     -z            Allow variable number of arguments to functions
     -phase 12345  Process only the phase that indicated
     -ansi         Check SQL statements for ANSI compliance
     -anyerr       Set status variable after expressions
     -globcurs     Make cursor declarations global to program
     -localcurs    Make scope of cursor declarations the module
     -nokeep       Delete the intermediate .4ec, .ec, and .c files
     -keep         Keep the intermediate .4ec, .ec, and .c files
     -static       Use static libraries
     -shared       Use shared libraries
     -otherargs    Other arguments are passed to the C compiler
     -o            Next argument is the name of the executable</pre>

<p>Not all platforms support the -shared option.  The
next two notes describe some "otherargs" options. </p>


<a name="i1086329o"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329o">Position-Independent Code</h3>

<p>The c4gl compiler also supports some additional flags
that produce position-independent code: </p>


<table id="wq28" width="100%" summary="" border="1" frame="border" rules="all">
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr valign="bottom">
<th id="wq29" align="left">FLAG </th>
<th id="wq30" align="left">EFFECT</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
<td headers="wq29">G-K PIC</td>
<td headers="wq30">position-independent code with Solaris</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="wq29">-K pic </td>
<td headers="wq30">position-independent code with Solaris</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="wq29">+z </td>
<td headers="wq30">position-independent code with H-P</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="wq29">+Z </td>
<td headers="wq30">position-independent code with H-P</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>These position-independent-code options were formerly
in effect by default. In Version 7.3x, however, you
must set the flag explicitly if you want this feature
(which can increase file size by 50% to 200%). The
PIC feature is not needed for executable programs,
but you must use it when you create shared libraries, </p>

<p>In Version 7.2 and earlier releases, "-static" was a
default c4gl option, but now "-shared" is the default
(specifying shared libraries). </p>

<p>If you use shared libraries, then LD_LIBRARY_PATH must
specify the order in which 4GL searches for the shared
libraries. (The name LD_LIBRARY_PATH is recognized by
Solaris systems, but see also the note about names
for LD_LIBRARY_PATH on other platforms in Section III,
"Notes on IBM Informix 4GL Installation Guide.") </p>

<a name="i1086329p"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329p">Creating Shared 4GL Objects</h3>

<p>IBM Informix 4GL (Compiled) supports the creation of
shared library executable objects.  Use of shared
library executable objects provides reduced memory
consumption, faster program start-up, and reduced
program file sizes (thereby saving file system space).
This feature is available only on platforms that can
support shared libraries. </p>

<p>For more technical information about shared library
concepts, please refer to your operating system
documentation.  If your system has "man pages"
(on-line manuals), the man page for "ld" may direct
you to the appropriate system documentation.
</p>

<p>Usage: </p>

<p>To compile a 4GL program into a shared object,
use the following command: </p>

<pre class="xmp">c4gl -o libname.so -G -K pic libprog.4gl</pre>

<p>Here libprog.4gl is the file containing the 4GL
functions that will go into the shared library. </p>

<p>To compile a 4GL application using the shared
object, use the following command: </p>

<pre class="xmp">c4gl -o prog prog.4gl -L<pathname> -llibname.so</pre>

<p>Here <pathname> is the path of the shared library. </p>


<a name="i1086329q"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329q">Suppressing Line Numbering with c4gl</h3>

<p>Unless you use the -nolinenos flag, a warning is
issued if your C compiler attempts to reference a
line number greater than 32,767 in a generated .ec
file. (Alternatively, you can avoid this warning
by using smaller .4gl source code modules, so each
generated .ec file has fewer than 32,767 lines.) </p>


<a name="i1086329r"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329r">Linking Object Files with cfglgo</h3>

<p>When you create a customized runner with cfglgo, you
cannot include among the "cfile.o" object files any
file that was compiled from a 4GL program. (The
cfglgo script has no syntax for linking the 4GL
libraries that would be required in this context.) </p>


<a name="i1086329s"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329s">The -api Option of cfglgo</h3>

<p>The syntax diagram for cfglgo omits the -api option.
This is required for C programs that call a compiled
p-code function of RDS. See the section "Compiling a
C Program That Calls 4GL RDS Functions" in Appendix
C for an example of this command-line option. </p>


<a name="i1086329t"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329t">Positioning the Comment Line</h3>

<p>The description on page 2-27, and the subsequent
descriptions in Chapter 4 of how OPEN WINDOW and
OPTIONS statements can reposition reserved lines,
neglect to mention that the Error line and Comment
line should not be assigned the same position.
Otherwise, if an error message appears in a field
that has the COMMENTS attribute, comment text will
overwrite the error message. (In Version 6.x and
earlier, comments did not overwrite error messages.) </p>



<a name="i1086329u"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329u">The SQLCODE Member of SQLCA</h3>

<p>In Chapter 2, the description of the SQLCA
record states that the finderr utility can provide
explanations of the SQL and 4GL error codes. </p>

<p>This is not false, but when 4GL is used with DRDA
to access a non-IBM-Informix database, the SQLCODE can
contain an error code from that database. This code
is generally unrelated to any IBM Informix error code of
the same value. The 4GL error log (and finderr) can
show only the IBM Informix error message, if SQLCODE
receives a value that matches an IBM Informix error code.
If the value does not match any IBM Informix error code,
then "Unknown error message" is reported. You should
refer to the documentation of the non-IBM-Informix
database for the actual meaning of such error codes. </p>


<a name="i1086329v"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329v">The SQLERRD Member of SQLCA</h3>

<p>In Chapter 2, the description of the SQLCA record
states that SQLERRD[6] "is the row ID of the last
row that was processed." This is often true, but
some SQL operations (such as SELECT ... FOR UPDATE)
set SQLERRD[6] to zero. 4GL can also access the
XPS database server, which does not support row IDs. </p>

<p>Note also that "the last row that was processed"
is not necessarily the last row that was inserted. </p>



<a name="i1086329x"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329x">The SQLERRM Member of SQLCA</h3>

<p>In Chapter 2, the description of the SQLCA record
states that "SQLERRM is not used at this time."
This is false. Whatever the database server stores
in SQLCA.SQLERRM (typically the first 70 bytes of
any SQL identifiers in the current error or warning
message from an SQL or SPL operation) is available
to 4GL programmers. See the "IBM Informix Guide to
SQL:Reference" for a description of SQLCA.SQLERRM. </p>


<a name="i1086329y"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329y">Passing CHAR Values</h3>

<p>Page 3-16 asserts that </p>

   <p>"When a value is passed between a CHAR variable
    and a CHAR database column, or between two
    CHAR values, exactly <size> bytes of data are
    transferred, where <size> is the declared
    length of the 4GL variable or the database
    column that receives the string." </p>

<p>This is not intended to obscure the fact that the
ASCII 0 terminator of a string stored in a CHAR
variable of 4GL (or in a C language string, or in
a char variable of the C language) is not stored
in a CHAR column of the database. </p>

<a name="i1086329z"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329z">Precision of SMALLFLOAT Values</h3>

<p>Chapter 2 asserts that SMALLFLOAT data types can
have up to 8 significant digits. On most platforms,
however, most SMALLFLOAT values have a precision
of only 6 digits. </p>



<a name="i1086329za"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329za">TEXT Values in Non-WORDWRAP Fields of Screen Forms</h3>

<p>If a 4GL form field that has no WORDWRAP attribute
displays a TEXT value whose display length is not
long enough to fill the field, the symbol "?"
(ASCII 63) is displayed after the last character
of the TEXT value. The "?" symbol also replaces
any unprintable character within the TEXT value. </p>

<p>If "?" in this context might confuse your users,
you can specify the WORDWRAP attribute in the
form specification to suppress this use of "?"
(which here represents a Linefeed character).
Whether or not you use WORDWRAP, however, these
"?" characters are screen display features only,
and are not saved as part of the TEXT data. </p>


<a name="i1086329zb"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zb">INVISIBLE Attribute on Systems that Use terminfo</h3>


<p>The last page of Chapter 3 asserts that terminfo
systems support only the REVERSE and UNDERLINE
display attributes. In fact, INVISIBLE is also
supported on some systems that use terminfo.
(Appendix F repeats this false assertion that no
terminfo systems support the INVISIBLE attribute.) </p>

<p>UNIX systems that provide terminfo services but
do not fully support the System V terminfo library
will not recognize the INFORMIXTERM environment
variable (which Appendix D describes). The terminfo
library must include the following functions: </p>
<pre class="xmp">
     setupterm()
     tigetstr()
     tigetflag()
     tigetnum()</pre>



<a name="i1086329zc"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zc">The ACCEPT Keyword in the ON KEY Clause</h3>

<p>In the ON KEY clause of CONSTRUCT, DISPLAY ARRAY,
INPUT, and INPUT ARRAY statements, IBM Informix
does not recommend that you specify ACCEPT as the
activation key. The Accept key is the usual means
by which the user terminates these statements,
so specifying ON KEY (ACCEPT) can prevent the
user from continuing to the next statement,
unless you provide some other EXIT path. </p>

<p>ACCEPT generally does not pose this "endless
loop" problem as an activation key in the ON KEY
clause of the PROMPT statement, or in the COMMAND
KEY clause of the MENU statement. </p>


<a name="i1086329zd"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zd">CONSTRUCT with FORMONLY Fields</h3>

<p>The description of CONSTRUCT in Chapter 4 implies
that only fields linked to database columns can
be referenced in the CONSTRUCT statement. This
is the usual way to perform query-by-example,
but CONSTRUCT can also use FORMONLY fields, as
in the following example: </p>
<pre class="xmp">
   CONSTRUCT where_clause
      ON A.Col01, A.Col02, B.Col03, C.Col04
      FROM FORMONLY.Fld01, FORMONLY.Fld02,
            FORMONLY.Fld03, FORMONLY.Fld04
</pre>

<p>The names embedded in the where_clause are those
in the ON list; the fields used are those in the
FROM list. </p>


<a name="i1086329ze"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ze">Search Criteria for Query by Example</h3>

<p>To search for a literal asterisk (*) or
question (?) mark, a double (\\) backslash
must precede the * or ? symbol, to escape the
special significance of these wildcards. </p>

<p>For fields linked to columns of character data
types, however, you cannot use wildcards after
the != or <> relational operators. In this
context, the * and ? wildcard characters are
interpreted as literal symbols. </p>


<a name="i1086329zf"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zf">The CONSTRUCT Input Control Blocks</h3>

<p>The syntax diagram indicates that the NEXT FIELD
keywords of the CONSTRUCT statement can be followed
by the Field Clause syntax segment. In fact, only
a subset that segment is valid in this context. You
cannot reference a specific record in a screen array by
qualifying a field name with "<screen array>[<line>]."
after the NEXT FIELD keywords. The "[<line>]" term is
not valid in this context, because CONSTRUCT can
reference only the first line of a screen array. </p>



<a name="i1086329zg"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zg">Variables in Declarations of Variables</h3>

<p>When the DEFINE statement declares a 4GL variable
that supports a parameter, such as the size of an
ARRAY, CHAR, or VARCHAR variable, or the precision
of a DECIMAL, FLOAT, or MONEY variable, you must
use literal integers, rather than variables, to
specify these values in the DEFINE declaration.
(Because 4GL variables take values only at runtime,
the compiler cannot evaluate variables that appear
within the declaration of another variable.) </p>

<p>Executable 4GL statements can use properly declared
and defined INT or SMALLINT variables as ARRAY
indexes to reference array elements within 4GL
expressions; but DEFINE is not executable. </p>


<a name="i1086329zh"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zh">Data Entry in 4GL Forms</h3>

<p>The following is true for statements of 4GL that
can support input control blocks, such as CONSTRUCT,
DISPLAY ARRAY, INPUT, and INPUT ARRAY. During input,
when the user enters a keystroke in a field of a 4GL
form, 4GL takes these actions: </p>

   <ul><li>It tests to see if the character that was typed
     is valid for the field.</li>

  <li>It tests to see if the character corresponds
     to the activation key of an ON KEY clause.</li>
     </ul>

<p>If neither of these conditions is true, then the bell
of the terminal rings, the field is cleared, and the
cursor is redisplayed at the beginning of the field,
without any entered characters. (In this case, the
field is regarded as "touched," in the sense that a
subsequent FIELD_TOUCHED() call will return TRUE.) </p>


<a name="i1086329zi"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zi">Specifying the Name of a Cursor as a Variable</h3>

<p>The DECLARE, OPEN, CLOSE, FETCH, and FREE statements of
SQL can reference the identifier of a cursor directly,
or can use a character variable containing the identifier
of the cursor. The CLOSE diagram on page I-4, the DECLARE
diagram on page I-10, the FETCH diagram on page I-12, the
FREE diagram on page I-14, and the OPEN diagram on page
I-18 all neglect to show that a variable is also valid. </p>



<h3 id="i1086329zj">Limit on Nested Cursors</h3>

<p>You can nest cursors within FOR, FOREACH, or WHILE
loops, so that a new cursor is declared for each
iteration on the previously declared cursor: </p>
<pre class="xmp">
   DECLARE name1 CURSOR FOR SELECT ...
      FOREACH name1
      DECLARE name2 CURSOR FOR SELECT ...
         FOREACH name2
         DECLARE name3 CURSOR FOR SELECT ...
</pre>
<p>No more than 16 levels of nesting are supported. </p>

<a name="i1086329zjj"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zjj">Executing FINISH REPORT Before ROLLBACK</h3>


<p>4GL reports internally use an INSERT cursor to create
their output. If you execute ROLLBACK WORK while the
report is executing, the last page of the report might
be empty, because ROLLBACK frees the buffer that holds
the input records. If you wish to avoid discarding data
in this way, execute FINISH REPORT before rolling back
any transaction while a 4GL report is executing. </p>

<h3 id="i1086329zk">Returning Values to the Calling Routine</h3>



<p>The description of the FUNCTION statement in Chapter 4
asserts that no more than 5 kilobytes of string values,
and no more than 10 values, can be returned as CHAR
data types by a 4GL function. This restriction affected
releases of 4GL earlier than 4.12, but is obsolete. In
this release, a 4GL function can return an indefinite
number of strings, with 32,767 bytes the maximum size of
an individual returned CHAR value. (TEXT values that a
4GL function returns can be longer.) Error messages
-4517 and -4518 are now obsolete. </p>


<a name="i1086329zl"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zl">The INPUT Control Block</h3>


<p>The syntax diagram indicates that the NEXT FIELD
keywords of the INPUT statement can be followed by the
name of a field. Text that follows, however, is not
correct when it asserts that you can reference a field
in a specific record of a screen array by qualifying
the field name with "<screen array>[<line>]." after
the NEXT FIELD keywords. The "[<line>]" term is not
valid in this context. </p>


<a name="i1086329zm"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zm">The INPUT ARRAY Input Control Blocks</h3>


<p>The description of statement blocks in this section
references the NEXT ROW clause. In fact, INPUT ARRAY
supports no NEXT ROW clause. </p>

<p>Several syntax diagrams in this section show that the
NEXT FIELD keywords of the INPUT ARRAY statement can be
followed by the Field Clause syntax segment. In fact,
only a subset that segment is valid in this context. You
cannot reference a specific record in a screen array by
qualifying a field name with "<screen array>[<line>]."
after the NEXT FIELD keywords. The "[<line>]" term is
not valid in this context. </p>

<p>Similarly, the BEFORE FIELD and AFTER FIELD control
blocks of INPUT ARRAY cannot reference a specific
screen record within the screen array. If present,
these clauses apply to every record of the array. </p>

<p>The section "The AFTER ROW Block" neglects to say that
control passes to the AFTER ROW statement block (if one
exists) after the user presses the Delete key. If both
the BEFORE ROW and AFTER ROW blocks are specified, then
deleting a row passes control to the AFTER ROW statement
block before the BEFORE ROW block is executed, contrary
to the default order of precedence that is listed in
the section "The Precedence of Input Control Blocks." </p>


<a name="i1086329zn"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zn">Assigning NULL Values with the LET Statement</h3>

<p>The description of LET on page 4-231 says that if you
use LET to assign to a variable a comma-separated list
of expressions, each of which evaluates as NULL, then
the variable is assigned a NULL value. If the variable
is of the CHAR or VARCHAR data type, however, then the
assigned value is ASCII 32 (a single blank space),
which 4GL uses in this context to represent NULL. </p>

<p>You cannot, however, assign a NULL value to a character
variable by executing a LET statement of the form: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
      LET x = " "
</pre>

<p>4GL interprets the resulting value of x as not NULL.
(This is in contrast with the PROMPT statement or a
screen forms, where a single blank space that the user
enters is stored as a NULL value, rather than as
a non-NULL string containing the ASCII 32 character.) </p>

<p>If x is declared as a CHAR or VARCHAR variable, then
the following LET statement assigns to x a NULL value: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
      LET x = ""
</pre>

<p>This is equivalent to the following statement: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
      LET x = NULL
</pre>

<p>To create an empty string (that is, a string of length
zero) that is not NULL, execute a LET statement like
the following example: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
      LET x = " " CLIPPED
</pre>


<a name="i1086329zo"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zo">The LOCATE IN FILE Statement</h3>

<p>If the IN FILE option of LOCATE references an existing
file, then 4GL attempts to use the contents of the file
to initialize the BYTE or TEXT variable. An error is
issued if the specified file is not writeable. </p>



<a name="i1086329zp"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zp">The Width of a Window Containing a Menu</h3>

<p>The description of the MENU statement states that: </p>

  <p>"Unless the title and at least one option can
   fit on the screen or in the current 4GL window,
   a runtime error occurs." </p>

<p>This is not accurate. A runtime error can occur if the
current window is not wide enough to include the larger
of these two values; </p>

   <ul><li>the width of the menu title, plus eight spaces,
       plus the width of the longest option;</li>

   (<li>the width of the longest Menu Help line message.</li>
   </ul>

<p>(This somewhat simplifies the actual rule.) IBM Informix
recommends that you verify by testing that your 4GL
menus can fit in the windows where they are displayed. </p>



<a name="i1086329zq"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zq">The COMMAND Clause of the MENU Statement</h3>

<p>If a COMMAND clause specifies a HELP message, then
the user can display this message by pressing the
Help key when the menu option is the current option.
The documentation neglects to indicate that pressing
the question ( ? ) mark key has the same effect. </p>

<p>In the section "The NEXT OPTION Clause," delete the
last sentence, which says: </p>

  <p>"4GL does not execute any of the statements that
   follow a NEXT OPTION clause within a MENU control
   block." </p>

<p>That sentence is false. The NEXT OPTION keywords do
not cause control of execution to jump to the COMAND
clause that they reference. </p>


<a name="i1086329zr"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zr">Specifying a Compiled Form Specification File as a Variable
</h3>

<p>The OPEN FORM statement of 4GL can reference a compiled form
specification file directly, or can use a character variable
containing the filename (with or without the ".frm" extension).
The OPEN FORM syntax diagram in Chapter 4 includes "filename" as
a quoted string, but neglects to show that a character variable
containing the filename of the compiled form specification
is also valid in this context. </p>

<p>This feature enables your program to use conditional logic to
specify a screen form at runtime, by assigning to the variable
the filename of an appropriate compiled form specification. </p>



<a name="i1086329zs"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zs">SQL Statements that Cannot Be Prepared
</h3>

<p>In the table on page 4-319 of unpreparable statements,
the "x" symbol is progressively misaligned towards
the bottom of the table. It always to the statement
immediately to the right. (This defect is repeated
on page 4-353, which also neglects to explain what the
"x" symbol signifies. Page 4-354 defines the symbol.) </p>

<a name="i1086329zt"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zt">The PROMPT Statement</h3>

<p>If the user enters an empty string (or a single blank
space, or only presses RETURN) as the response, this
is stored as a NULL value. </p>

<p>If you specify PROMPT FOR CHAR, the user cannot
type a CONTROL sequence as the response. If the user
presses the Interrupt (or Quit) key, the effect depends
on whether DEFER INTERRUPT (or DEFER QUIT) appears in
the MAIN program block. If DEFER INTERRUPT or DEFER
QUIT was not specified, Interrupt or Quit terminates
the program. Otherwise, control of execution passes
to the statement that follows the PROMPT statement,
with NULL stored as the response value.) </p>

<p>Contrary to the list in "The ON KEY Blocks," the
RETURN key is not supported in the ON KEY block of
the PROMPT statement. (But RETURN is valid in the
ON KEY blocks of other 4GL statements.) </p>

<p>See also the note "Exclusion of the Current Date
by P and F Options" elsewhere in this document.
This is relevant if the response variable has a
DATE or DATETIME data type, and you specify the
CENTURY attribute in the ATTRIBUTE clause. </p>



<a name="i1086329zu"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zu">Two-Pass Reports</h3>

<p>The description of which REPORT definitions require
two passes to produce their output is imprecise,
although the first condition that is sufficient to
require a two-pass report is correctly stated: </p>

  <p>"An ORDER BY section without the EXTERNAL keyword." </p>

<p>The second sufficient condition is identified as: </p>

  <p>"The GROUP PERCENT(*) aggregate function anywhere
   in the report." </p>

<p>But GROUP PERCENT(*) is valid only in AFTER GROUP OF
control blocks, so "anywhere" is potentially misleading. </p>

<p>The third sufficient condition is identified as: </p>

  <p>"Any aggregate function outside the AFTER GROUP OF
   control block." </p>

<p>But a more accurate (and more restrictive) replacement
for that condition is this: </p>

  <p>"Any aggregate function that has no GROUP keyword in
   any control block other than ON LAST ROW." </p>

<p>A report that does not satisfy at least one of these
three conditions produces its output in a single pass. </p>


<a name="i1086329zv"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zv">Aggregate Functions in Two-Pass Reports</h3>

<p>Conditional aggregates are calculated on the first pass,
when the input records are read, and are printed on the
second pass. Aggregates are not valid in a loop, such as
FOR, FOREACH, or WHILE, where the WHERE clause changes
dynamically. If you attempt to calculate an aggregate
function in this context, no value is returned. </p>



<a name="i1086329zw"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zw">The RUN ... RETURNING Clause</h3>

<p>The description of the RUN statement asserts that the
variable that follows the RETURNING keyword can be of
the INT or SMALLINT data type. This is not false,
but if you use an INT variable to store the 2-byte
value that is returned, some operating systems extend
the sign-bit, and others simply pad the high-order 2
bytes of the variable with 0. Consequently, if the
program returns -1, some systems will extend the sign
and return -1, and some will pad with 0 and return
255. The same inconsistency can happen if the program
returns 255. </p>

<p>For consistent results across different platforms,
use a SMALLINT variable in this context. </p>

<p>The same description of the RETURNING clause in the
RUN statement includes the following assertion: </p>

  <p>If a Quit signal causes the termination, the integer
  value is (3*256), or 758.
 </p>
<p>This is incorrect; the product of 3 and 256 is 768. </p>


<a name="i1086329zx"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zx">Variables in ON EVERY ROW Control Blocks</h3>


<p>The description of ON EVERY ROW in Chapter 7 correctly
asserts that: </p>

  <p>"4GL delays processing the PAGE HEADER control block
   (or FIRST PAGE HEADER control block, if it exists)
   until it encounters the first PRINT, SKIP, or NEED
   statement in the ON EVERY ROW control block." </p>

<p>This means that when output is first produced by the
PRINT statement in the ON EVERY ROW control block of
a 4GL report, any value that was assigned to a program
variable in the [FIRST] PAGE HEADER control block is
the value that appears in the output from the report,
rather than whatever value the ON EVERY ROW control
block may have assigned to the same variable. </p>

<p>This is illustrated in the following example:
 </p>

<pre class="xmp">
   MAIN
      DEFINE c1 integer
      DEFINE i SMALLINT

      WHENEVER ERROR CONTINUE
      DROP DATABASE "tc18909"

      WHENEVER ERROR STOP
      CREATE DATABASE "tc18909"
      CREATE TABLE tab1 (c1 serial)

      FOR i = 1 TO 25
         INSERT INTO tab1 VALUES (0)
      END FOR

      DECLARE cs CURSOR FOR SELECT *
         FROM tab1 ORDER BY c1
      START REPORT listrep to "out"
      FOREACH cs INTO c1
         OUTPUT TO REPORT listrep (c1)
      END FOREACH
      FINISH REPORT listrep

   END MAIN

   REPORT listrep (c1)
      DEFINE c1 integer
      DEFINE str1, str CHAR(40)

      OUTPUT
         PAGE LENGTH 10
         LEFT MARGIN 0
         RIGHT MARGIN 80
         TOP MARGIN 0
         BOTTOM MARGIN 0

      FORMAT
         PAGE HEADER
            LET str = "+++++PAGE HEADER+++++"
            PRINT str

        ON EVERY ROW
            LET str = c1
            PRINT str
   END REPORT
</pre>

<p>Here the PRINT statement in ON EVERY ROW prints </p>

<pre class="xmp">
            +++++PAGE HEADER+++++
</pre>

<p>rather than an input record from the database. </p>

<p>To modify this report so that ON EVERY ROW prints
an input record, replace the original PAGE HEADER
control block with the following code: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
         PAGE HEADER
            LET str1 = "+++++PAGE HEADER+++++"
            PRINT str1
</pre>


<a name="i1086329zy"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zy">Variables in the START REPORT Statement</h3>

<p>The description of START REPORT in Chapter 4 neglects to
specify that the value specified for the TOP OF PAGE eject
character can also be a character variable. A quoted
string is also valid, as the manual correctly states. </p>

<p>For the various LENGTH and MARGIN page dimensions, you
can specify an integer expression. This implies that
(among other expressions) a literal number or a variable
of data type INTEGER or SMALLINT is valid. </p>


<a name="i1086329zz"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zz">Locks Released by START REPORT</h3>

<p>In an unlogged database that uses an update cursor,
the START REPORT statement releases the lock on the
current row. This can lead to concurrency problems,
if another user manipulates that row. Similarly,
any SQL Data Definition Statement (as listed near the
beginning of Chapter 4) within the control blocks of a
report can have this effect on an unlogged database. </p>



<a name="i1086329zza"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zza">The ARR_COUNT() Function</h3>

<p>Page 5-27 makes the following assertion: </p>

  <p>"If SET_COUNT() was explicitly called, ARR_COUNT()
   returns the greater of these two values: the
   argument of SET_COUNT(), or the highest value
   attained by the array index." </p>

<p>This is true if the most recent call to SET_COUNT()
specified an argument no larger than the physical
size of the program array, but 4GL does not require
that SET_COUNT() take an argument that is logically
consistent with the declared size of the array. </p>

<p>Before the INPUT ARRAY statement begins execution,
if you call SET_COUNT() with an argument larger
than the array size, then calling ARG_COUNT() in
an INPUT ARRAY control block returns the maximum
value of the array index, even if this value is
smaller than the argument of SET_COUNT(). </p>



<a name="i1086329zzb"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzb">The CLIPPED Operator with a Blank Operand</h3>

<p>If its operand is a string containing only whitespace,
then the CLIPPED operator returns a single blank space
(rather than an empty string or NULL). </p>



<a name="i1086329zzc"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzc">The CURRENT Operator and the Current Database</h3>

<p>When the CURRENT operator appears in a 4GL statement
that is not an SQL statement, the returned DATETIME
value is calculated from the calendar-clock of the
client system that is running the 4GL application,
rather than from the system that supports the current
database, if that is a different system. (In an SQL
statement, CURRENT is evaluated from the calendar-clock
of the system that supports the current database, even
if the SQL expression that includes the CURRENT operator
references a table in another database. To obtain the
CURRENT time from a remote database server, first make
it the current database with the DATABASE statement.) </p>


<a name="i1086329zzd"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzd">The CURSOR_NAME() Function</h3>

<p>In a database that does not use implicit transactions,
but where transaction logging is in effect, error -255
is issued if you attempt to open a cursor FOR UPDATE
outside a transaction. The BEGIN WORK statement is
required in this context before opening the cursor. </p>


<a name="i1086329zze"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zze">The FGL_GETKEY() Function</h3>

<p>The Chapter 5 description of FGL_GETKEY() is defective
where PROMPT appears in the code example. The logic
requires the MESSAGE statement, rather than PROMPT: </p>

<p>Also, the value that FGL_KEYVAL("RETURN") returns is not
what FGL_GETKEY returns after the RETURN key is pressed. </p>

<p>Alternatively, here is another code example: </p>

 <pre class="xmp">
 DEFINE key INT
   MESSAGE "Press 'y' to continue. Any other key to abort. "
   LET key = FGL_GETKEY()
   IF key = FGL_KEYVAL("y") OR key = FGL_KEYVAL("Y")
      THEN
         CALL continue()
      ELSE
         CALL quit()
   END IF
</pre>


<a name="i1086329zzf"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzf">The LENGTH() Function</h3>

<p>Because LENGTH() disregards trailing whitespace, any
character string argument that contains only whitespace
characters returns zero. If LENGTH() is called with a
NULL argument, the returned value is also zero. You
cannot use LENGTH() to distinguish between strings of
(any number of) whitespace characters and NULL strings. </p>



<a name="i1086329zzg"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzg">SMALLINT Values for mkmessage</h3>

<p>As the description of the SHOWHELP() function implies in
Chapter 5, the integer values of help message numbers must
be in the SMALLINT range. Appendix B neglects to specify
this restriction (to values no greater than 32,767). </p>



<a name="i1086329zzg"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzg">DATETIME Values with INCLUDE</h3>

<p>To specify a DATETIME or INTERVAL value for the INCLUDE
attribute, use the numeric DATETIME format (without any
qualifiers) or the numeric INTERVAL format (without any
qualifiers), and enclose the value between quotation
marks. For example, the following FORM4GL code </p>

<pre class="xmp">
   f000 = testtb.c1, include=("10:10:10");
</pre>

<p>specifies a valid DATETIME or INTERVAL value to include.
(4GL determines the data type of the f000 field from the
data type of the testtb.c1 column in the database.) </p>



<a name="i1086329zzh"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzh">CHAR Values with INCLUDE</h3>

<p>The last code example in the description of the INCLUDE
attribute in Chapter 6 is not valid. The "(*)" symbols
that follow the CHAR keyword must be deleted, because
they elicit error -2018. Do not specify "(*)" (nor any
other length) for FORTMONLY fields. FORM4GL does not
recognize the default length of CHAR(1) for CHAR fields,
but infers the length of CHAR fields from their physical
size within the SCREEN section of the form specification. </p>


<a name="i1086329zzi"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzi">Compiling a Form in Quiet Mode</h3>


<p>The syntax description of FORM4GL does not identify
the effect of the "-q" option. If you specify "-q" (or
equivalently, if you specify "-s" as the first option),
then FORM4GL compiles the specified form "silently,"
suppressing any prompts or other screen messages. </p>



<a name="i1086329zzj"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzj">Comment Option of VALIDATE Menu</h3>

<p>Page B-7 implies that what you enter can include as many
as 80 characters ("it must fit on a single screen line"),
but in fact, the text cannot be longer than 64 characters.
The Comment line might not display all of the text if you
include TAB, NEWLINE, or CONTROL-N characters. (The
description of the COMMENTS attribute in Chapter 6 also
omits these restrictions on the number of characters.) </p>


<a name="i1086329zzk"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzk">Handling Interrupts in C Programs that Call 4GL Functions</h3>

<p>Because the DEFER INTERRUPT statement is not valid outside
the MAIN program block, handling Interrupt signals is not
trivial in C programs that call 4GL functions (but have no
MAIN statement of 4GL). A method that is not supported
(but that is usually reliable) for handling Interrupts is
to call the _efidefer() function after your program calls
fgl_start(). The _efideref() function sets the Interrupt
handler to one that correctly sets the INT_FLAG variable,
and is included in the standard 4GL libraries. See also
the fglsys.h header file. </p>


<a name="i1086329zzl"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzl">The FGL_CALL() Macro</h3>

<p>In the example on C-22, the call is: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
    fgl_call(get_customer, 1);
</pre>

<p>There are at least three problems with this section. </p>

<ol><li>The parameter type for funcname should be:

<p><pre class="xmp">
    int (*funcname)();          /* K&R */
    int (*funcname)(int);       /* ANSI */

</pre></p>
     <p>The programmer cannot, for example, specify: </p>
<p><pre class="xmp">
    fgl_call("get_customer", 1);</li>
</pre><p></p>

<li>There is no mention that the function needs
    to be declared (though not necessarily defined)
    before it can be used an argument to FGL_CALL().</li>

<li>The examples do not show that you should check
    that the correct number of values are returned
    from the 4GL function that was invoked.

     <p>A better example would be something like this: </p>
<p><pre class="xmp">
    n = fgl_call(get_customer, 1);
    if (n != 1)
        fatal("incorrect number of return values from get_customer");
        </pre></p>
        </li>
        </ol>

<p>In addition, on page C-20, ARG_VAL() and NUM_ARGS()
should not be in boldface, and the phrase "MAIN
function block" should be "MAIN program block,"
because the MAIN statement is not a 4GL "function."
(For example, unlike a 4GL function, you cannot
use the FUNCTION statement to define the MAIN
program block it, nor CALL to invoke it; it is
not reentrant; and it cannot return a value to
its calling routine.) </p>

<h3 id="i1086329zzm">The fglrt.h Header File</h3>

<p>The reference to the fglrt.h file is incorrect, and should

<h3 id="i1086329zzn">4GL Function Names in C Programs</h3>

<p>As page 2-3 indicates, uppercase letters in any 4GL
identifier are automatically shifted to lowercase during
compilation. In a C programs that calls an 4GL function,
do not use uppercase characters to specify the name of
the 4GL function in the call.  Otherwise, an "unresolved

in the C code cannot match the corresponding lowercase
characters in the name of the compiled 4GL function. </p>

<h3 id="i1086329zzp">Starting Up the Database Server</h3>


<p>Appendix D neglects to say that if environment variables

those settings also take effect for client systems that
do not explicitly set the same environment variable. </p>


<a name="i1086329zzq"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzq">Date-Related Environment Variables</h3>


<p>The descriptions of DBCENTURY and DBDATE in Appendix D,
and the references to GL_DATE and GL_DATETIME in Appendix E
are generally correct, but they neglect to discuss the
possible consequences of using abbreviated years in DATE or
DATETIME literals in some contexts if DBCENTURY is reset.
Problems can occur if the database uses a different rule
for expanding abbreviated years (or if DBDATE, GL_DATE,
or GL_DATETIME is reset to change the order of time units
within literal DATE or DATETIME values) after an IBM
Informix database object whose behavior is sensitive to
literal DATE or DATETIME values has been defined. </p>

<p>IBM Informix databases use DBCENTURY to expand 1-digit
and 2-digit year values, and use DBDATE, GL_DATE, and
GL_DATETIME to specify the order of time units within
literal DATE or DATETIME expressions in SQL statements
and in various database objects, including these: </p>

   <ul><li>check constraint expressions</li>
   <li>fragmentation expressions</li>
   <li>stored procedures</li>
   <li>triggers</li>
   <li>user-defined routines (UDRs)</li>
   </ul>

<p>Unintended behavior can result if one or more environment
variables are subsequently reset, if the new settings change
the way in which DATE or DATETIME literals are evaluated by
the database object. </p>

<p>In earlier releases, the server interpreted the DATE or
DATETIME literal using the date environment settings in
effect at execution time. Here "date environment settings"
include the following:

   <ul><li>the explicit or default date format setting (such as
     what DBDATE, GL_DATE, or GL_DATETIME specify).</li>
     <li>the creation date of the database object that is
     associated with the DATE or DATETIME literal.</li>
     <li>the explicit or default DBCENTURY setting.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Now, however, a literal date is always interpreted using
the date environment settings prevailing at the creation
time of the object with which the DATE or DATETIME literal
is associated. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: The following example (of the legacy behavior)
           assumes that DBDATE is set to "MDY2-" and that
           the time of execution is within the interval
           between 31 December, 1899, and 30 June, 1994. </p>

<p>Here is an example: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
     Unset DBCENTURY
     create table t (d date)
        fragment by expression
           d < '07-01-94' in dbs1,
           d >= '07-01-94' and d <= '12-30-94' in dbs2,
                 remainder in dbs3;
     Set DBCENTURY = P
     insert into t values ('04-15-1980');
</pre>

<p>Old behavior: The row goes into dbs3, because the
fragmentation expression is interpreted at insert time
and is treated as </p>

<pre class="xmp">
     d < '07-01-1894' in dbs1,
     d >= '07-01-1894' and d <= '12-30-1894' in dbs2,
           remainder in dbs3
</pre>

<p>New behavior: The row goes into dbs1, because the
fragmentation expression is interpreted based on the
DBCENTURY value at the time of creation, and is treated
as </p>
<pre class="xmp">
     d < '07-01-1994' in dbs1,
     d >= '07-01-1994' and d <= '12-30-1994' in dbs2,
           remainder in dbs3
</pre>

<p>The next example is based on changes to another
date-related environment variable, DBDATE: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
     Unset DBDATE
     create table t (d date check (d <= '12-31-1995'));
     Set DBDATE = y4md
     insert into t values ('1995-10-31');
</pre>

<p>Old behavior: Error 1218 (string to date conversion). This
is because the date in the check constraint (12-31-1995)
is being interpreted by the environment at the time of
insert, but because DBDATE is y4md, it gives an error. </p>

<p>New behavior: insert succeeds. The 12-31-1995 has been
interpreted according to the environment at the time of
object creation, and is successfully converted into a
valid date, so there is no error. The environment
settings at runtime are ignored. </p>

<p>Note, however, that in this example, the DATE value in
the INSERT statement is evaluated according to the date
environment at runtime, using only the current settings
of environment variables. Only database objects, not SQL
statements (nor other 4GL statements), make any
distinction between the date environment at the
time-of-object-creation and the runtime environment
in interpreting literal date values. </p>

<p>Note also that this new behavior only takes effect for
database objects that are created with a version of the
database server that supports this feature. Previously
created objects will not change in behavior. For this
reason, if the new behavior is more desirable, you must
drop and then recreate the existing database objects. </p>

<p>For example, if constraints use a DATE or DATETIME
literal, the constraints can be dropped and recreated
by using ALTER TABLE or ALTER FRAGMENT. </p>

<p>The new behavior is not backward-compatible to all
IBM Informix database server releases, but these
Version 5.x, 7.x, and 9.x releases (and some '
subsequent releases) support the new behavior: </p>

  <ul><li>5.10.UC8 (UNIX & NT)</li>
  <li>7.23.TC16 (NT)</li>
  <li>7.24.UC9 (UNIX)</li>
  <li>7.30.UC9 (UNIX and NT)</li>
  <li>7.31.UC3 (UNIX & NT)</li>
  <li>9.14.UC7 (UNIX & NT)</li>
  <li>9.20.UC1 (UNIX & NT)</li>
  <li>9.21.UC1 (UNIX & NT)</li>
  <li>9.30.UC1 (UNIX & NT)</li>
</ul>

<p>For releases earlier than those listed here, if the
new behavior is desired, you must drop and recreate
any existing time-expression-dependent objects. In '
the case of check constraints (for example), you can
use ALTER TABLE, and then recreate the fragmented
tables, either by dropping and recreating them, or
by running ALTER FRAGMENT on the tables. </p>

<p>This is a feature of the database server, rather
than a feature of IBM Informix 4GL, but this
feature takes effect in database objects that are
referenced within 4GL programs when the current
database is of a release version in the list above.
4GL makes no distinction between time-of-creation
and time-of-execution for any environment variable.
The new behavior of the database server eliminates
the possibility of discrepancies in certain SQL
operations involving database objects, but it does
not prevent changes to settings of DBDATE (or of
DBCENTURY, or of GL_DATE, or of GL_DATETIME) from
affecting actions of the 4GL client program (for
example, based on the INCLUDE field attribute)
that are independent of the database server. </p>


<a name="i1086329zzr"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzr">Exclusion of the Current Date by
P and F Options</h3>

<p>For the DBCENTURY environment variable and the
CENTURY field attribute, the P and F settings
exclude the current date, which is not yet in the
past nor in the future. For example, if today is
July 4, 1999 and DBCENTURY = P, then 4GL interprets
"07/04/99" is interpreted as "07/04/1899", not as
"07/04/1999". Similarly, if today is July 4, 1999
and DBCENTURY = F, then "07/04/99" is interpreted
as "07/04/2099", rather than as "07/04/1999".
(See also the next note.) </p>


<a name="i1086329zzs"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzs">Requiring 4-Digit Years in Data Entry</h3>


<p>The CENTURY field attribute and the DBCENTURY
environment variable specify ways of automatically
expanding 2-digit years. Some problems can be
avoided if the user always enters a 4-digit year,
but this is not an easy requirement to enforce
within 4GL. In theory, you can use the PICTURE
and REQUIRED attributes with a DATE or DATETIME
format in which the YEAR value precedes the DAY
or MONTH value. But except within organizations
for which the YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-DD-MM formats are
familiar to users, it is often not acceptable to
require YEAR as the first value in a date. Thus,
for the 4GL code to require 4-digit years might
not be a practical option for most developers. </p>



<a name="i1086329zzt"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzt">The DBFORMAT Environment Variable</h3>

<p>If DBFORMAT is set, it overrides the currency
formatting specifications of the DBMONEY
environment variable or of the locale files. </p>

<a name="i1086329zzu"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzu">The DBMONEY Environment Variable</h3>

<p>If DBMONEY is set, it overrides the currency
formatting specifications of the locale files.
If DBFORMAT is also set, then the DBFORMAT
settings override the DBMONEY settings. </p>



<a name="i1086329zzv"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzv">Default Search Path for IBM Informix SE</h3>

<p>The description of the default search path when DBPATH
is not set for an IBM Informix SE database is incomplete.
For 5.0 and earlier IBM Informix SE database servers,
the default path for databases (if DBPATH is not set)
is the user's home directory on the database server
that holds the current database. Version 6.0 of IBM
Informix SE has no default, however, so DBPATH must
always be set in any 4GL applications that access an
IBM Informix SE Version 6.0 database. (In general,
however, it is better to upgrade to a more recent
database server version.) </p>


<a name="i1086329zzw"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzw">Printing the Screen</h3>

<p>Appendix D neglects to describe the DBSCREENOUT and
DBSCREENDUMP environment variables that support saving
the current 4GL screen display as a file. If you specify
a pathname as the setting of DBSCREENOUT or DBSCREENDUMP
(or if you specify a different pathname for each of them),
then the user can press CONTROL-P to print the screen at
any time. </p>



<a name="i1086329zzw2"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzw2">Reserved Words</h3>

<p>The names of the 25 pop and return library functions for
manipulating the 4GL argument stack, as listed on pages
C-5 through C-8, cannot be used as 4GL identifiers, but
are omitted from Appendix G, "Reserved Words": </p>
<pre class="xmp">
popdate
popdec
popdub
popflo
popint
popinv
poplong
popquote
popshort
popstring
popdtime
popvchar
poplocator
retdate
retdec
retdtime
retdub
retflo
retint
retinv
retlong
retquote
retshort
retstring
retvchar
</pre>
<p>These functions are renamed in Version 7.31; see
Appendix C for the new names and for descriptions
of these functions. C code for use with releases
of 4GL earlier than Version 7.31 that calls any
of the pop, push, or return functions must be
recompiled with fglsys.h header file to map the
pre-Version 7.31 names onto the new function names. </p>

<p>(These names are reserved words that can cause
unexpected behavior if you declare any of these
names as the identifier of a 4GL function or report,
or as an argument to a 4GL function or report.) </p>



<a name="i1086329zzx"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzx">User Names in an ANSI-Compliant Database</h3>

<p>Appendix I shows the "user" name in some SQL statements
(such as GRANT on page I-15) without enclosing quotation
marks. In an ANSI-compliant database, however, any user
name that is not enclosed between quotation marks has
its letters automatically upshifted to uppercase. This
can result in an error, if the actual user name that is
not enclosed between quotes includes lowercase letters.
The REVOKE diagram on page I-19 repeats this error. </p>


<a name="i1086329zzy"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzy">Error Message -4339</h3>

<p>The description of Error Message -4339 that "finderr"
can display is incomplete. The following description
is more accurate: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
  -4339 4GL has run out of data space memory.
</pre>

<p>Your 4GL program requires more memory than is available.
If your program was executing successfully prior to this
message, examine your code to see if FREE, CLOSE FORM,
CLOSE WINDOW, or other 4GL statements can release memory
used by 4GL program objects that are no longer needed. </p>

<p>If your program was using a shared memory connection, try
setting INFORMIXSHMBASE to a larger value. Alternatively,
use a streams (olipcstr) or network (oltlitcp) connection. </p>

<p>If you receive this message during compilation, a .4gl
source module might be too large to compile. Divide it
into smaller modules, and compile them separately. If the
error persists, divide the 4GL program into smaller programs. </p>

<p>No other problems are known to exist with this manual. </p>

<h2 id="i1086329aa">VII. Notes on IBM Informix 4GL By Example</h2>


<a name="i1086329zzz"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329zzz">Obsolete or Missing Features</h3>

<p>This book was written in 1991. It does not follow the
typographic convention of other 4GL manuals in displaying
programmer-defined 4GL and SQL identifiers in boldface.
Similarly, this book does not illustrate features that
have been added to 4GL (or to the IBM Informix
implementation of SQL) after Version 4.10. It offers
an abundance of code examples for typical RDBMS
programming tasks, and it shows how to use the essential
features of 4GL. </p>

<p>Chapter 14 pre-dates the (Version 6.0) TERMINATE REPORT
statement, as well as the features of START REPORT that
support program variables for dynamically specifying at
runtime the page dimensions for output from 4GL reports. </p>

<p>Page 339 uses a CASE statement to chose among three
different START REPORT statements, according to a user-
supplied destination for the report output. Version 7.31
of 4GL can equivalently support a single START REPORT
statement with a variable to specify the destination. </p>

<p>For various reasons, using row IDs (as in Chapters 10,
18 or 27) is no longer recommended by IBM Informix as
an access method.  Instead, use primary keys. The
row ID examples still work, but IBM Informix might
discontinue support for row IDs in some future release.
(The IBM Informix Extended Parallel Server (XPS) database
server does not support row IDs, and the term "row pointer"
will in the future replace "row ID" as a construct for
referencing a specific row in the database.) </p>

<p>References in Chapter 22 to Informix STAR and Informix NET
are obsolete when 4GL is used with current IBM Informix
database servers, which incorporate equivalent functionality
for connectivity.  The same chapter omits CONNECT (which 4GL
can directly embed) as another SQL statement that can open
a database. </p>


<a name="i1086329ab"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ab">Non-Standard 4GL Terminology</h3>

<p>Page 32 refers to "the MAIN function." Reader are reminded,
however, that although MAIN, REPORT, and FUNCTION are program
blocks, the MAIN and REPORT statements of 4GL differ in many
significant ways from the FUNCTION statement. They cannot,
for example, be declared by the FUNCTION statement, nor can
they be invoked by the syntax for calling a 4GL function.
In addition, they are not re-entrant, they do not use the
4GL function stack for their arguments, and they cannot
return values to a 4GL calling context. </p>

<p>Several other chapters repeat this imprecise terminology, or
refer to REPORT definitions as "Report Functions." Unlike
4GL functions, 4GL reports are not reentrant, cannot appear
in an expression, cannot be invoked by CALL, cannot return
a value to the calling context, cannot terminate with RETURN,
and typically require an active connection to a database. </p>

<p>The reference in Chapter 22 to the IBM Informix SE database
server as "the standard engine" is non-standard terminology
(and here "SE" is not an abbreviation for "Standard Engine").
As noted elsewhere in these notes, "Informix OnLine" is no
longer the name of "IBM Informix Dynamic Server," but in
this book "OnLine" means an IBM Informix database server that
uses raw devices, rather than C-ISAM and UNIX system calls,
to store the database tables and other schema elements. </p>

<p>Chapter 30 refers to "the system catalogs" of a database,
but in current terminology, all the tables that a database
maintains to describe its own schema are collectively known
as "the system catalog" (singular). IBM Informix Version 7.3
and later databases include more system catalog tables than
this chapter (which was written for Version 4.10) describes. </p>

<p>Page 156 refers to INFIELD() as a "built-in function."
In fact, INFIELD() is an operator, rather than a function.
Page 326 refers to the COLUMN, PAGENO, TODAY, and USING
keywords of 4GL as "functions" or "clauses." All these
are actually operators of 4GL. (Thus, an error results
if the CALL statement attempts to invoke any of them.)
4GL manuals did not distinguish systematically between
functions and operators before Version 6. Some manuals
are not yet consistent on this topic. but Chapter 5
of the "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual" is accurate. </p>

<p>Page 293 describes the fglgets() function. Because the
characters "fgl" begin the names of some internal functions
that 4GL uses, IBM Informix recommends that you avoid these
characters as the first characters of a programmer-defined
identifier, rather than risk name conflicts. The same
applies to the function called fglgetret() on page 312.
See Appendix G of the "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual"
for more information about potential name-space problems
in 4GL identifiers. </p>

<p>On page 320, what the diagram calls a "row producer" is
called a "report driver" elsewhere in the 4GL documentation
set. Similarly, what the diagram calls a "report generator"
is now called a "report" or "report definition"; and what
the diagram calls a "report" is now "output from a report."
In the description of the to_hex() function in Chapter 30,
the terms "power characters" and "power digits" are both
usually called "digits in the exponent." </p>


<a name="i1086329ac"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ac">Example 18 Compilation</h3>


<p>Because Example 18 illustrates the use of BYTE, TEXT,
and VARCHAR data types, compilation errors will occur
if you compile the file ex18.4gl (or its screen form
specification files f_catadv.per, f_catalog.per, and
f_catdescr.per) directly or by the fglexcopy script
if your current database is IBM Informix SE. These data
types are all supported by the IDS database server.
(The 4GL code includes a runtime test for your type of
database server, but this cannot prevent compilation
errors when IBM Informix SE is the compile-time server.) </p>


<a name="i1086329ad"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ad">The SQLAWARN Array</h3>

<p>Chapter 22 notes that SQLAWARN is automatically reset
to describe any new database that the CREATE DATABASE
or DATABASE statement opens. It should also have added
CONNECT to this list of statements. (The "4GL Reference
Manual" repeats the same omission on page 2-45.) </p>


<a name="i1086329ae"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ae">Typographic and Factual Errors</h3>

<p>On page 371, the ERROR statement uses "left" and "right"
double quotation (") marks to delimit a string. These two
symbols should be "straight" quotation marks, as in the
enclosing IF statement and elsewhere in code examples. </p>

<p>The qual_fld() function description in Chapter 30 asserts
that "6 = 4 - 0" when in fact 6 is greater than (4 - 0).
The arithmetic should instead be "6 = (4 - 0 + 2)" here. </p>

<p>A note on the convert_type() function in Chapter 30
says that DECIMAL(p) data types (with no declared scale)
are floating-point numbers. This is true in databases
that are not ANSI-compliant. In an ANSI-compliant
database, however, DECIMAL(p) implies a scale of zero,
meaning that only integer data values can be stored. </p>

<p>The Function Index neglects to indicate that it lists
(in uppercase) some 4GL operators. Some listed functions
like retshort() and popquote() are C library functions
(which Appendix C of the "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual"
describes). </p>

<p>No other problems are known to exist with this manual. </p>

<h2 id="i1086329ag">Notes on Guide to the IBM Informix 4GL Interactive Debugger
</h2>


<a name="i1086329af"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329af">ASCII Characters Only</h3>
<p>Page 6 of the Introduction implies that the Debugger is
GLS-enabled. This is false. Use instead the Dynamic 4GL
product if you wish to debug a 4GL program that displays
non-ASCII characters. In addition, the non-ASCII characters
that appear on page 6 are not supported in some versions of
the codeset of the 8859-1 locale. </p>



<a name="i1086329ah"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ah">Post-4.10 SQL Syntax</h3>

<p>Page 8 of the Introduction incorrectly states that </p>

  <p>"no SQL statements and syntax extensions introduced by
   Informix servers of version 5.0 and later are recognized" </p>

<p>by the Debugger. SQL statements later than Version 4.10
that can be directly embedded in this version of 4GL are: </p>

<pre class="xmp">
   CONNECT
   CREATE PROCEDURE FROM
   DISCONNECT
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
   FOREACH ... WITH REOPTIMIZATION
   OPEN ... WITH REOPTIMIZATION
   SET CONNECTION
</pre>

<a name="i1086329ai"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ai">Deviations from Conventions in This Manual</h3>

<p>Page 10 of the Introduction shown an icon for features
that comply with the X/Open Portability Guide. The
Interactive Debugger has no features, however, that
can be characterized in this way. </p>

<p>Page 14 of the Introduction shows an example that is
not a Debugger command. This will fail if the 4GL
application uses cursor-mangling. (This example is
valid, however, for Dynamic 4GL.) </p>

<p>Page 16 of the Introduction describes a manual
called the "Informix 4GL Quick Syntax." A manual
of this name was provided with Version 7.2 and
earlier 4GL releases, but not with this release. </p>

<p>Appendix I of the "IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual,"
however, is the "Quick Syntax" section describing
SQL syntax that can be directly embedded in 4GL code. </p>

<p>On page 1-20, the illustration incorrectly shows no
Debugger command highlighted in the initial display
of the HELP command. When you issue the HELP command
with no other argument, the _escape command name is
highlighted (because it is appears at the top left
of the list of Debugger commands). Arrow keys can
move the highlight to the desired Debugger command. </p>

<p>On page 2-3, the reference to "page 7" should be
to page 7 of the Introduction. </p>

<p>On page 2-7, the gap between lines 188 and 189 is
without significance, and the lowercase characters
for CLIPPED in line 190 are valid (but deviate from
the documentation convention of uppercase keywords).
Many code examples in this manual also use lowercase
letters for Debugger keywords. </p>

<p>The gap between lines 239 and 240 on page 2-8 (and
similar gaps elsewhere in code listings of this
manual) are also without significance. </p>

<p>As page 2-9 reveals, the first seven chapters of
this manual does not follow the convention of the
other 4GL manuals, which append trailing
parentheses to all function names. </p>


<a name="i1086329aj"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329aj">Messages from RDS</h3>

<p>On page 2-10, the message </p>
<pre class="xmp">

</pre>
<p>is incorrect. What is displayed is this: </p>
<pre class="xmp">
  "Form compilation in progress...please wait"
</pre>
<p>but with no quotation marks. (This error is repeated
on the same page for program compilation.) </p>

<p>On page 3-25, the "Variable" segment in the syntax
diagram should include a reference to page 9-16. </p>



<a name="i1086329ak"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329ak">Abbreviated Commands</h3>

<p>On page 9-26, the shortest form of the GROW
COMMAND command is "g c" (rather than "c"). </p>

<p>On page 9-27, the shortest form of the HELP
WHERE command is "h wh" (rather than "h wr"). </p>

<p>On page 9-27, the shortest form of the HELP
WRITE command is "h wr"; no form is shown. </p>



<a name="i1086329al"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329al">Incorrect Syntax</h3>

<p>Page 12 of the Introduction references the
syntax segments of the "IBM Informix Guide to
SQL: Reference." In this release, however, the
database server manual that provides this
information has "IBM Informix Guide to SQL:
Syntax" as its title. </p>

<p>Beginning on page 9-29, disregard the section
"Conventions for Command Syntax Notation,"
which was erroneously included in this book.
See "Syntax Conventions" on page 11 of the
Introduction for the notation used in this book. </p>

<p>In the last paragraph of page 9-98, "reca.b"
should be in boldface in the first line, because
it is a 4GL identifier. </p>

<p>On page 9-99, the reference to "Informix Guide to
SQL:Reference" is obsolete. Refer instead to
Chapter 3, "Data Types and Expressions," in the
"IBM Informix 4GL Reference Manual." The assertion
is false, that the data types which a 4GL program
can support are dependent on the database server. </p>

<p>On page 9-107, the syntax diagram requires the
term "function" in place of "variable." The VIEW
command cannot specify the name of a variable. </p>


<a name="i1086329am"></a>
<h3 id="i1086329am">Example Programs</h3>

<p>Page 5 of the Introduction and Appendix C refer to
"Sample Programs," but the examples in Appendix C
are neither the result of sampling nor capable of
sampling in the usual statistical sense of "sample."
(Appendix B lists a 4GL program that can produce
pseudo-random samples of natural numbers.) </p>
